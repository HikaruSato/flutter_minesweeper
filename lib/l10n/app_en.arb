If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game.\n\nOtherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or \"0\"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered.\n\nTap-and-hold on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it.
